        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Kaptech Dev</strong>. Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy document outlines the types of information that is collected and recorded by our applications (including but not limited to <em>Counter Tasbih Pro</em> and <em>Follower Booster</em>) and how we use it.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            By using our applications, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms. This policy is effective as of February 2026.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. We want to inform you that we do not collect any personal data directly on our own private servers. All data processing is handled through secure Google infrastructure.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not ask for names or addresses. If an app requires login, it is handled via <strong>Google Sign-In</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Our apps may collect non-sensitive info like device model, OS version, and unique identifiers for advertising purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
        <p>To ensure high-quality service, app integrity, and monetization, we work with the following trusted third-party providers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> Used for core app functionality and security updates.</li>
            <li><strong>AdMob:</strong> Used to display advertisements. AdMob may use advertising IDs to show relevant ads to you.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Realtime Database:</strong> Used in specific apps (like Follower Booster) for temporary and secure data synchronization. All data is encrypted and stored using Google's security protocols.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We encourage you to read their privacy policies at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Security and Integrity</h2>
        <p>We prioritize the security of your data. For applications involving user accounts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Password Protection:</strong> We never see or store your passwords. Authentication is managed by Google.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Utility data (like tasbih counts) is stored locally on your device. Sync data is stored in Firebase using strict "Security Rules" to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Log Data</h2>
        <p>Whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the app, we collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>

        <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact and Support</h2>
